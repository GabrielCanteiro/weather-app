# Weather App

This is a simple weather application built using React and Vite. It allows users to search for the current weather based on location input and displays the temperature, description, and other relevant information.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and then run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install all necessary dependencies and start the development server at `http://localhost:5174`.

## Usage

To use the weather app, simply enter a location into the search bar and press the search button. The application will fetch weather data from the OpenWeather API and display the results.

Note that you will need an API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) in order to run the application. Set the environment variable `VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY` to your OpenWeather API key before starting the development server.
